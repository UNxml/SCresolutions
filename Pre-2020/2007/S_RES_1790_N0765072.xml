That is why it has devoted special attention to the task of building and strengthening the capacities of the Iraqi Army and the internal security forces, given that those are the two institutions that can guarantee security, maintain order and confront terrorist and other outlaw groups. Our national forces have successfully taken over the security functions of the multinational force in Iraq (MNF-I) in eight governorates. It is our intention that our national forces will continue to take over those security functions until all 18 governorates are under the full security control of our troops in 2008. Our ground force command has assumed control of all the divisions of the Iraqi Army. The effective coordination between the command and MNF-I has had a positive effect on the security situation.</p>

A review of the role and authority of MNF-I will thus be required in order to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the need to extend, one last time, the mandate of the force and, on the other hand, progress made by Iraq in the area of security. In this regard, it is important for Iraq to be treated as an independent and fully sovereign State and, in seeking the aforementioned balance, the following objectives should be highlighted:</p>

                <p xml:space="preserve">	Iraqi security forces continue to make progress in developing their capabilities as they move into the lead in taking responsibility for Iraq’s security. This year, the Iraqi Ground Forces Command has assumed control of all Iraqi Army divisions. Iraqi authorities and local security forces have assumed primary security responsibility in eight of Iraq’s provinces, and we are working together for continued progress in transition of security responsibility in all of Iraq’s eighteen provinces. Together we will build towards the day when the Iraqi forces assume full responsibility for the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq.</p>
