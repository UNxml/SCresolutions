On behalf of the Government and people of Iraq, I express my gratitude to the Governments of the States that have contributed to those forces and to the forces themselves for the services rendered during their presence in the territory, waters and airspace of Iraq.</p>

                <p xml:space="preserve">	Iraq has inherited debts and claims from the previous regime and has made great progress in settling them. However, much remains to be done, and our efforts to settle those claims and debts will require some time. Temporary support from the international community will continue to be required during the coming phase. Therefore, we hope that the international community will continue current protections and arrangements for petroleum, petroleum products, and natural gas from Iraq and the proceeds thereof until such time as the Government of Iraq is able to take the measures necessary to settle those debts and claims inherited from the previous regime. Oil revenues constitute 95 per cent of Government resources, and these claims have an impact on reconstruction and the economic transformations taking place in Iraq, and consequently pose a grave threat to Iraq’s stability and security and by extension to international peace and security.</p>

Therefore, bearing in mind the exception provided for in paragraph 27 of United Nations Security Council resolution 1546 (2004), Iraq requests that the Security Council continue to implement the provisions of paragraph 22 of United Nations Security Council resolution 1483 (2003) until 31 December 2009, including those relating to funds or other financial assets or economic resources mentioned in paragraph 23 of that resolution.</p>

The Iraqi Government recognizes that the Development Fund for Iraq plays an important role in helping Iraq to reassure donors and creditors that Iraq is administering its resources and debts in a responsible manner in the service of the Iraqi people. It should be noted that Iraq is attempting, after years of isolation under the previous regime, to form a new partnership with the international community with a view to integrating its economy into those of the region and the world through the International Compact with Iraq, and its efforts were endorsed by more than 90 countries and international organizations in the Stockholm Declaration of 29 May 2008. In view of this, Iraq requests the Security Council to extend the mandates of the Development Fund for Iraq and the International Advisory and Monitoring Board for a period of 12 months, with a review of the extension to be conducted before 15 June 2009 at the request of the Government of Iraq.</p>
