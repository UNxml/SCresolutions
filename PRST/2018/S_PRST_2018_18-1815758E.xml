It is, in the Council’s own words, “one of the core issues on its agenda”*. In order to facilitate the Council’s consideration of protection of civilians concerns in a given context, including at the time of the establishment or renewal of peacekeeping mandates, in June 2001, Council Members suggested that an Aide Memoire, listing the relevant issues, be drafted in cooperation with the Council (<a href="https://undocs.org/S/2001/614">S/2001/614</a>). On 15 March 2002, the Council adopted the Aide Memoire as a practical guide for its consideration of protection of civilians issues and agreed to review and update its contents periodically (<a href="https://undocs.org/S/PRST/2002/6">S/PRST/2002/6</a>). It was subsequently updated on five occasions, and each updated version annexed to a Presidential Statement*. </p>
