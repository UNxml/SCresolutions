The Security Council also strongly condemns the rise of incitement to ethnic and religious hatred and violence that threaten the peace and stability of the Central African Republic (CAR), as well as manipulated hostility towards the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the CAR (MINUSCA) and other international actors.</p>

The Security Council reiterates the urgent and imperative need to hold accountable those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights. The Security Council also recalls that committing acts of incitement to violence, in particular on an ethnic or religious basis, and then engaging in or providing support for acts that undermine the peace, stability or security of the CAR is a basis for sanctions designations pursuant to resolution <a href="https://undocs.org/S/RES/2399(2018)">2399 (2018)</a>.</p>

The Security Council further stresses the need for the definitive operationalization of the Special Criminal Court and the establishment of the Truth, Justice, Reparations and Reconciliation Commission, as well as bolstering the other national accountability mechanisms. The Security Council calls on CAR authorities to implement the reform of the security sector in order to put in place multi-ethnic, professional, representative and well-equipped national defence and internal security forces, the disarmament, demobilization and repatriation of members of armed groups, as well as the acceleration of the implementation of the National Strategy for Recovery and Peace Consolidation (RCPCA).</p>
