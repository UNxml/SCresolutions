The Security Council reiterates the need to ensure organization and coherence in the efforts of the United Nations System to address trafficking in persons in areas affected by armed conflict or in post-conflict situations, and further recognizes the need to continue to work towards an enhanced, comprehensive and coordinated approach. The Security Council encourages further cooperation between the EU, AU and UN, in particular within the joint Task Force, aimed at saving and protecting lives of migrants and refugees along routes, and in particular inside Libya.</p>
