In this context, the Security Council looks forward to the ICGLR summit, scheduled to take place on 31 July in Nairobi, to further review developments in the region, including progress on the implementation of the PSC Framework.

The Security Council calls on all countries of the region to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of neighbouring countries, not to interfere in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries, not to harbour persons accused of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law or persons listed by United Nations sanctions regimes, and promote accountability. The Security Council calls on all countries of the region neither to tolerate nor provide assistance or support of any kind to armed groups.</p>

The Security Council reaffirms in this context the leading role of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in coordinating support for security sector reform provided by international and bilateral partners and the United Nations system, and his role in assisting the government of the DRC to implement its commitments under the PSC Framework. The Security Council also reiterates that the government of the DRC bears the primary responsibility for security, protection of civilians, promotion and protection of human rights, national reconciliation, peacebuilding and development in the country. </p>
