      <paragraph eId="para_3" class="SingleTxt">
        <content eId="para_3__content">
          <p xml:space="preserve">		“The Security Council reiterates its strong condemnation of the appalling attacks and war crimes and crimes against humanity carried out by the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and its violations of international humanitarian law and abuses of human rights. The Council condemns further the LRA’s recruitment and use of children in armed conflict, killing and maiming, rape, sexual slavery and other sexual violence, and abductions. The Council demands an immediate end to all attacks by the LRA and urges the LRA to release all those abducted, disarm and demobilise. The Council welcomes the recent progress made with regard to ending LRA war crimes and crimes against humanity in Central Africa and reiterates its resolve to maintain the current momentum until a permanent end to the threat posed by the LRA has been achieved.</p>

          <p xml:space="preserve">		“The Security Council welcomes the diplomatic efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General Abou Moussa and AU Special Envoy on the LRA Issue Francisco Madeira to strengthen regional cooperation and facilitate renewed AU-Regional Task Force (AU-RTF) operations in the region. The Council urges the United Nations Office for Central Africa (UNOCA), in its coordination role, as well as the United Nations political and peacekeeping missions in the region and other relevant United Nations presences to enhance their efforts in support of the implementation of the United Nations Regional Strategy to Address the Threat and Impact of the Activities of the LRA (the UN strategy), as appropriate and within the limits of their mandates and capacities. The Council encourages the Secretary-General to optimise UNOCA’s efforts in this regard, including through the use of staff and provision of support to anti‑LRA efforts. The Council also calls on the international community to support the implementation of the UN strategy where possible. The Council notes in this regard the meeting of the International Working Group on the LRA (IWG-LRA) co-chaired by the European Union and the United States on 4 October 2013 in Brussels. </p>
        </content>

          <p xml:space="preserve">		“The Security Council reiterates its strong support for the African Union Regional Cooperation Initiative against the LRA (AU RCI-LRA), and commends the significant progress made by the AU-RTF. The Council welcomes in particular the AU-RTF’s enhanced operations against LRA camps in recent months, which have increased pressure on the LRA command structure and degraded the LRA’s capabilities. The Council urges all regional governments to fulfil all their commitments under the AU RCI-LRA and to provide the necessary basic provisions for their security forces. The Council encourages neighbouring states to cooperate with the AU-RTF, in order to end the LRA threat. The Council further encourages all states in the region to take measures to ensure that the LRA is not able to operate with impunity in their territory. The Council notes the importance of continued international support for the AU-RTF’s operations, logistics, and headquarters. The Council underlines the need for all military action against the LRA to be conducted in compliance with international law, including international humanitarian law, human rights law and refugee law, as applicable, and to minimise the risk of harm to civilians in those areas. </p>

The Council welcomes the efforts undertaken by, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Republic of South Sudan, Uganda and the Central African Republic (CAR), in coordination with the African Union, to end the threat posed by the LRA, and urges further efforts from these countries, as well as from other countries in the region. </p>

          <p xml:space="preserve">		“The Security Council expresses its serious concern that the continued instability and increased security vacuum in the CAR continue negatively to affect counter-LRA operations and to contribute to the reinforcement of the LRA in the country. The Council further notes with concern that LRA attacks in the CAR have reportedly taken place in areas outside of the AU-RTF’s principal area of operations. In this regard, the Council emphasises the need for strong coordination and information-sharing between BINUCA, the AU-RTF and the African-led International Support Mission for the Central African Republic (MISCA) in the context of their protection of civilians activities and counter-LRA operations. </p>
        </content>

In this context the Council encourages further and reinforced efforts by MONUSCO to address the LRA including through improved responsiveness to imminent threats to civilians, training and capacity building of the FARDC, support to the Joint information Operations Centre (JIOC), and implementation of the DDRRR robust programme to encourage and facilitate further LRA defections.</p>

The Council urges both missions to enhance cooperation with the AU-RTF in order to coordinate operations, patrols and protection of civilians strategies. The Council encourages MONUSCO and UNMISS to provide appropriate logistical support to the AU-RTF, within their existing mandates and resources, and to cooperate closely with the AU-RTF in response to anticipated protection of civilians threats. The Council also notes the mandate of the United Nations-African Union Hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA) to cooperate and share swiftly information related to the regional threat of the LRA. In line with the UN strategy, the Council stresses the need for enhanced cross-border coordination, including through the use of common Standard Operating Procedures and swift information-sharing between these missions, as well as among all other relevant actors in the region, to better anticipate LRA movements and imminent threats of attack. </p>

The Council notes the conclusion of the Secretary-General in his most recent report on UNOCA and the LRA (<a href="http://undocs.org/S/2013/671">S/2013/671</a>) that increased poaching activities have contributed to concerns over security in the CAR and the wider region and are used to finance transnational criminal networks and armed rebel groups, including the LRA.</p>

The Council highlights the importance of programmes in support of the release, return and successful reintegration of children abducted by the LRA, in particular those that target community acceptance of such children.</p>

The Council notes reports that small groups of LRA fighters in the CAR are seeking to disarm and surrender. In this regard, the Council urges BINUCA to work with the Transitional Authorities in the CAR to ensure that all efforts to encourage LRA defections adhere to UN LRA DDR Standard Operating Procedures. </p>

          <p xml:space="preserve">		“The Security Council commends efforts by international donors to provide humanitarian assistance to LRA-affected populations in the CAR, the DRC and the Republic of South Sudan. The Council reaffirms its call for all parties to allow safe and unhindered access for humanitarian organisations to the civilian population, consistent with the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law and the UN guiding principles of humanitarian assistance. The Council encourages donors to increase funding for humanitarian and early recovery projects outlined in the UN strategy. The Council also expresses concern about the departure of many humanitarian actors from LRA-affected areas in the DRC and the lack of regular humanitarian access to many LRA-affected communities in the CAR and the DRC, including because of poor infrastructure, and encourages increased UN efforts and international donor support for creating conditions conducive to improved and timely passage of relief consignments, equipment and personnel. </p>
