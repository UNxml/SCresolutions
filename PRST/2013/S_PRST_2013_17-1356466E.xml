It underlines that the recent achievements of the FARDC in defeating M23 on the ground must encourage the Government of DRC to sustain efforts to neutralize FDLR and other armed groups.

The Security Council urges the Government of the DRC to finalize the development of a comprehensive Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) and Demobilization, Repatriation, Reintegration and Resettlement (DDRRR) plan.
