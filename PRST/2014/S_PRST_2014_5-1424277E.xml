The Council expresses particular concern about sexual and gender-based violence and violations and abuses against children in situations of armed conflict. The Council recognizes the importance of ending impunity for such acts through strengthened police, justice and corrections capacity, and the incorporation of gender and child protection perspectives in all rule of law programmes, including through justice sector reform and sexual, child protection and gender based violence training. The Council recalls in this regard resolutions <a href="http://undocs.org/S/RES/1325(2000)">1325 (2000)</a>, <a href="http://undocs.org/S/RES/1612(2005)">1612 (2005)</a>, <a href="http://undocs.org/S/RES/1820(2008)">1820 (2008)</a>, <a href="http://undocs.org/S/RES/1882(2009)">1882 (2009)</a>, <a href="http://undocs.org/S/RES/1888(2009)">1888 (2009)</a>, <a href="http://undocs.org/S/RES/1889(2009)">1889 (2009)</a>, <a href="http://undocs.org/S/RES/1960(2010)">1960 (2010)</a>, <a href="http://undocs.org/S/RES/1998(2011)">1998 (2011)</a>, <a href="http://undocs.org/S/RES/2068(2012)">2068 (2012)</a>, <a href="http://undocs.org/S/RES/2106(2013)">2106 (2013)</a> and <a href="http://undocs.org/S/RES/2122(2013)">2122 (2013)</a>. The Council reiterates its intention when establishing and renewing the mandates of United Nations missions to include provisions for the protection of children and on the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women in conflict and post-conflict situations, including through the appointment of child protection and gender advisers and provisions to protect children’s rights and to facilitate women’s full participation and access to justice through legal, judicial and security sector reforms, and wider post-conflict reconstruction processes.</p>

The Council recognizes in this regard the contribution of the International Criminal Court, in accordance with the principle of complementarity to national criminal jurisdictions as set out in the Rome Statute, towards holding accountable those responsible for such crimes. In this regard, the Council reiterates its call on the importance of State cooperation with these courts and tribunals in accordance with the States’ respective obligations. The Council further reiterates its intention to continue forcefully to fight impunity and uphold accountability with appropriate means. The Council notes the Secretary-General’s issuance of the latest guidance on contacts with persons who are the subject of arrest warrants or summonses issued by the International Criminal Court.</p>
