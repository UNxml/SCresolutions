The Council also expresses its continuing concern regarding maritime insecurity in the Gulf of Guinea, the illegal wildlife trade and transnational organised crime. The Council welcomes the local and parliamentary elections held in the sub-region and stressed the need for upcoming elections in the region to be held in a timely, transparent and inclusive manner according to their constitutions, and encouraged UNOCA to continue to support States in this regard including through the promotion of women’s political participation.</p>

The Council demands an immediate end to all attacks by the LRA and urges the LRA to release all those abducted, and to disarm and demobilise. The Council welcomes the progress made with regard to ending LRA war crimes and crimes against humanity in Central Africa and reiterates its resolve to maintain the current momentum until a permanent end to the threat posed by the LRA has been achieved.</p>

The Council commends Francisco Madeira for his leadership and welcomes the recent appointment of Lieutenant General Jackson Kiprono Tuwei (Rtd.) as the new AU Special Envoy for the LRA Issue. The Council urges UNOCA, in its coordination role, as well as the United Nations political and peacekeeping missions in the region and other relevant United Nations presences to enhance their efforts in support of the implementation of the United Nations Regional Strategy to Address the Threat and Impact of the Activities of the LRA (the UN strategy), as appropriate and within the limits of their mandates and capacities. The Council encourages the Secretary-General to optimise UNOCA’s efforts in this regard, including through the use of staff and provision of support to counter-LRA efforts.</p>

The Council commends the significant progress made by the AU-RTF and its troop contributing countries, and pays tribute to the important role played by the Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces in tackling the LRA threat. The Council urges all regional governments to fulfil their commitments under the AU RCI-LRA. The Council notes the importance of continued international support for the AU-RTF’s operations, logistics, and headquarters. In this regard, the Council welcomes the continued advisory and logistical support provided by the United States as well as funding provided by the European Union. The Council underlines the need for all military action against the LRA to be conducted in compliance with international law, including international humanitarian law, human rights law and refugee law, as applicable, and to minimise the risk of harm to civilians in all areas of operation and to take into account the association of children with the LRA. The Council also reiterates its encouragement to deploy child protection advisers within the AU-RTF.</p>

The Council calls upon the affected states to ensure that the LRA does not find safe haven in their territory, in accordance with international law. The Council takes note that the presence of some senior LRA leaders in the disputed Kafia Kingi enclave, on the border between CAR, South Sudan and Sudan continues to be reported. The Council takes note that the Government of Sudan has denied this. The Council welcomes the invitation extended to the AU to verify reports of LRA presence in Kafia Kingi, and encourages the AU Commission and the AU Peace and Security Council to verify the allegations. The Council expresses its continued concern that the gravity of the national crisis in the CAR and strongly condemns the LRA’s opportunistic cooperation in CAR with other armed groups including some ex-Séléka combatants. </p>

The Council emphasises the need for operational coordination and information-sharing between the AU-RTF and all relevant UN and AU missions, in the context of their protection of civilians activities, human rights monitoring, implementation of Disarmament, Demobilization, Repatriation, Reintegration and Resettlement (DDRRR) programmes, and counter-LRA operations, as appropriate and in accordance with their mandates.</p>

          <p xml:space="preserve">		“The Security Council expresses deep concern at the terrorist attacks conducted by Boko Haram since 2009, which have caused large-scale and devastating loss of life and represent a threat to the stability and peace of West and Central Africa. In particular, the Council strongly condemns the continued increase in attacks perpetrated by the terrorist group in Nigeria, along the Nigeria-Cameroon border, in the northern provinces of Cameroon and attacks near the Nigeria-Chad border. The Council expresses concern that the activities of Boko Haram continue to have adverse humanitarian impact on West and Central Africa including the displacement of an estimated 80,000 Nigerians into neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger. The Council commends the initiative of the Heads of States of the Lake Chad Basin region and the Republic of Benin to enhance cooperation, in line with the outcomes of the Paris Summit, then follow-up London and Abuja Summits and the meeting in Niamey, in order to tackle the threat posed by Boko Haram to the region. The Council calls on UNOCA to continue its collaboration with the United Nations Office for West Africa (UNOWA), in order to continue to support, as appropriate, the states of the Lake Chad Basin region to address the impact of the threat on peace and security, including the political, socioeconomic and humanitarian situation in the sub-region. The Council underlines the need for all actions to counter Boko Haram to be conducted in compliance with international law, including international humanitarian law, human rights law and refugee law.</p>
