          <p xml:space="preserve">	At the 7296th meeting of the Security Council, held on 5 November 2014, in connection with the Council’s consideration of the item entitled “The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo”, the President of the Security Council made the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>

      </alinea>
      <paragraph eId="para_3" class="SingleTxt">
        <content eId="para_3__content">
          <p xml:space="preserve">	“The Security Council expresses its deep concern over the lack of progress of the voluntary disarmament process of the Forces Démocratiques de Libération du Rwanda (FDLR), as assessed by the joint International Conference of the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) — Southern African Development Community (SADC) communique of 20 October. The Security Council recalls its press statement of 3 October and stresses again that there should be no further delay beyond the 2 January 2015 end date set by the region for the voluntary disarmament process. The Security Council calls on MONUSCO and the DRC government to immediately update operational plans for military action that should begin no later than January against the FDLR. The Security Council reiterates once again its call on the government of DRC, in coordination with MONUSCO, to immediately undertake military action against those leaders and members of the FDLR who do not engage in the demobilization process or who continue to carry out human rights abuses. </p>
        </content>

      <paragraph eId="para_4" class="SingleTxt">
        <content eId="para_4__content">
          <p xml:space="preserve">	“The Security Council further recalls that the swift neutralisation of the FDLR is a top priority in bringing stability to and protecting the civilians of the DRC and the Great Lakes region, in line with the wider commitments made in the Peace, Security and Cooperation (PSC) Framework for the DRC and the region. The Security Council recalls that leaders and members of the FDLR were among the perpetrators of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, during which Hutu and others who opposed the genocide were also killed, and recalled that the FDLR is a group under United Nations sanctions, operating in the DRC, and which has continued to promote and commit ethnically based and other killings in Rwanda and in the DRC. The Security Council reiterates its call on the region to comply with the commitments under the PSC Framework and to neither tolerate nor provide assistance or support of any kind to armed groups and to neither harbor nor provide protection of any kind to persons accused of violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights, in particular war crimes, crimes against humanity, acts of genocide, or persons falling under the United Nations sanctions regime. The Security Council further reiterates its readiness to consider targeted sanctions against any individual or entity found to be supporting the FDLR or any other armed group in the DRC.</p>

          <p xml:space="preserve">	“The Security Council strongly condemns the recent attacks by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in the Beni territory, brutally killing over 100 civilians, mostly women and children. The Security Council takes note of president Kabila’s statement to immediately engage further military action to neutralize this group permanently, with the support of MONUSCO. In accordance with its resolution 2147 (2014), the Security Council underlines the importance of ensuring effective protection of civilians. The Security Council emphasizes that any effort to undermine MONUSCO’s ability to implement its mandate will not be tolerated and that those responsible for threats or attacks against peacekeepers must be held accountable.</p>

The Security Council stresses the need for all parties to overcome barriers to repatriation at the 7 November meeting in Kinshasa and reminds former M23 combatants of their commitments under the Nairobi declarations.</p>

The Security Council stresses the strategic importance of this agreement and called upon all signatories to work together in a reinvigorated way in order to ensure delivery of the commitments made under the Framework. The Security Council expresses concern over the continued slow progress on Security Sector Reform (SSR) in the DRC, including the establishment of an FARDC Rapid Reaction Force, and calls on the government of DRC to consolidate progress on the restoration of State authority and the wider governance, economic and SSR reforms needed in the DRC. </p>
