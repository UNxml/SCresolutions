          <p xml:space="preserve">	“Following the completion of the 12-month mandate of the United Nations Mission in Colombia (the Mission) on 25 September 2017, the Security Council welcomes the remarkable achievements in Colombia following the Final Agreement for Ending the Conflict and Building a Stable and Long Lasting Peace reached between the Government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia — People’s Army (FARC-EP).</p>

          <p xml:space="preserve">	“The Security Council takes note of the report from the Secretary-General of 25 September (<a href="https://undocs.org/S/2017/801">S/2017/801</a>) and welcomes the assessments, recommendations and lessons learned therein. The Security Council expresses its intention to take them into account in the context of its ongoing efforts to enhance the overall effectiveness of United Nations missions.</p>

The Council pays tribute to the political will of the parties in achieving these milestones and to the leadership and spirit of cooperation they demonstrated in calling for the United Nations to partner with them in an innovative tripartite monitoring and verification mechanism (MVM). The Security Council emphasises that their determination and commitment has ensured that Colombia’s peace process continues to be a source of inspiration for the resolution of conflicts globally and retains the potential to set an example for peace processes elsewhere in the world.</p>

        <content eId="para_5__content">
          <p xml:space="preserve">	“The Security Council expresses its gratitude for the exemplary manner in which the Mission, led by Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Jean Arnault, accomplished the two tasks mandated to it by the Security Council, based upon the agreement by the Parties, in having coordinated the MVM for the monitoring and verification of the ceasefire and cessation of hostilities and overseen the laying down of arms process. The Security Council underscores that this work played a vital role in supporting the successful implementation of the corresponding provisions in the peace agreement. The Council welcomes the Mission’s work with the MVM to promote a gender-sensitive approach. The Council expresses its appreciation to the Mission for delivering the swift, flexible and tailored support envisaged by the Council and demonstrating the potential of the United Nations at its best.</p>

          <p xml:space="preserve">	“The Security Council notes the equally important work still ahead to implement the specific security, political and socio-economic provisions of the Final Peace Agreement and reaffirms the need for both parties to fulfil their commitments to achieve a lasting peace. In that regard, the Council recalls resolutions <a href="https://undocs.org/S/RES/2366(2017)">2366 (2017)</a> and <a href="https://undocs.org/S/RES/2377(2017)">2377 (2017)</a> which established and mandated the United Nations Verification Mission to verify implementation by the Government of Colombia and the FARC-EP of the process of political, economic and social reincorporation of the FARC-EP and the implementation of personal and collective security guarantees. The Council trusts that the work of the Verification Mission will be a strong source of support and encouragement for Colombia’s peace process.”</p>
