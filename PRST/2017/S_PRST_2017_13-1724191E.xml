While noting that the security situation in the country has remained generally calm, it remains alarmed by the increasing numbers of refugees outside the country and disturbed by reports of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killings, as well as by the persisting political impasse in the country and the attendant serious humanitarian consequences. </p>

The Security Council underscores its deep concern regarding the continued worsening of the humanitarian situation, marked by nearly 202,000 internally displaced persons, 3 million people in need and more than 416,000 Burundians seeking refuge in neighbouring countries, and commends the host countries for their efforts, and calls upon governments in the region to respect their international obligations relating to the status of refugees, and to ensure that their return is voluntary, based on informed decisions and in safety and dignity. </p>

It welcomes the condemnation of such statements by CNDD FDD officials and calls on the Government of Burundi to ensure that those responsible for such acts are held accountable. It strongly urges the Government of Burundi and all parties to cease and reject any kind of violence and condemn any public statement inciting violence or hatred, and demands that all sides in Burundi refrain from any action that would threaten peace and stability in the country and may affect regional stability in the long run, or undermine the East African Community-led, African Union-endorsed  inter-Burundian dialogue.

The Security Council welcomes the decision of the African Union (AU) at its 29th summit, which reaffirms the AU’s commitment to the peaceful resolution of the crisis in Burundi through the rapid launching of an inclusive inter‑Burundian dialogue, under the aegis of the EAC, with the support of the AU, and which requests all the Burundian stakeholders to participate actively and unconditionally in this process. It further stresses that this dialogue is the only viable process for a sustainable political settlement in Burundi. The Security Council remains deeply concerned over the lack of progress in this dialogue. The Security Council welcomes the report by facilitator Mkapa to the 20 May EAC summit and calls for the immediate implementation of the roadmap on the way forward. The Security Council stresses the urgent need for active engagement of the EAC member States for the regional mediation, facilitated by Benjamin Mkapa, to be continued and to succeed.
