The Security Council underlines the importance of international cooperation and solidarity, welcomes the efforts and contributions of UNOWAS, the African Union, ECOWAS and other member states, and calls for continued support and enhanced cooperation to ensure a comprehensive and inclusive response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including equal and affordable access to a vaccine as well as essential health services, and for actions to prevent the harmful effects of the pandemic on the right of every child to education and to support education that is inclusive, equitable and of quality, using accessible and inclusive distance-learning solutions to close the digital gap.</p>
