          <p xml:space="preserve">	“The Security Council expresses concern at the deterioration in the overall humanitarian situation in the region, exacerbated by the effects of the COVID‑19 pandemic and notably characterised by the impact of forced displacement, extreme poverty, food insecurity that is particularly severe in the Sahel and Lake Chad Basin, social inequalities and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence and reaffirms the need to ensure access to education and healthcare. The Security Council calls for safe, sustained and unhindered access for the delivery of humanitarian and medical aid to all persons in need, including access to sexual and reproductive healthcare, and mental health and psychosocial services for survivors of sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations without any discrimination. It further calls for significant humanitarian and development actions, including through the mobilization of resources for funding the Humanitarian Response Plans, as well as the disbursement of previously pledged funds. The Security Council condemns all forms of violence and intimidation against humanitarian and medical personnel and encourages efforts by States in the region to ensure that perpetrators of such acts are brought to justice, as provided for by national laws and consistent with their obligations under international law. </p>

The Security Council underlines the importance of international cooperation and solidarity, welcomes the efforts and contributions of UNOWAS, the African Union, ECOWAS and other member states, and calls for continued support and enhanced cooperation to ensure a comprehensive and inclusive response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including equitable, and affordable access to safe and effective vaccines as well as essential health services.</p>
