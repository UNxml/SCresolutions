In this regard, the Security Council welcomes the start of registration for the South Sudan referendum on 15 November and encourages further efforts to ensure that the referenda are held on 9 January 2011 in accordance with the CPA and as scheduled in the timeline published for the South Sudan Referendum by the South Sudan Referendum Commission (SSRC). The Security Council is concerned by the continued delays in releasing to the SSRC the full funding needed for preparations to continue to move forward. The Security Council calls on the parties and all Member States to respect the outcome of credible referenda, held in accordance with the CPA, that reflect the will of the people of Southern Sudan and Abyei.

In this context, the Security Council welcomes progress in the negotiations, led by President Mbeki, towards a ‘Framework for Resolving Outstanding Issues Relating to the Implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the Future Relations of North and South Sudan’, on which agreement was reached on 13 November.

In this context, the Security Council calls on all parties to protect civilians and maintain full, safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers to the population in need of assistance. The Security Council notes the need to support efforts to halt arms flows into Darfur in contravention of the arms embargo strengthened by resolution 1945 (2010).
