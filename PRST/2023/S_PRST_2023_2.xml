      <paragraph eId="para_2" class="SingleTxt">
        <content eId="para_2__content">
          <p xml:space="preserve">		“The Security Council reaffirms its strong commitment to an inclusive, Libyan-led and Libyan-owned political process, facilitated by the United Nations and supported by the international community, as well as its strong support for the people of Libya to determine who governs them through elections and to ensure this legitimate demand is heard through the political process.</p>

          <p xml:space="preserve">		“The Security Council commends the role played by Egypt to facilitate talks in Cairo between the House of Representatives (HoR) and the High State Council (HSC). The Security Council welcomes, in this regard, the gradual progress made on the constitutional framework for elections and the 13th amendment of the constitutional declaration. The Security Council recognises the continued role of the HoR and HSC and underlines the need for new momentum to build on this progress, to secure the legal basis and political agreement essential to conduct free, fair, transparent, inclusive and secure national presidential and parliamentary elections in 2023 across the country and to complete Libya’s political transition.</p>

The Security Council commends the SRSG’s extensive consultations with Libyan and regional stakeholders, and the international community, to identify a consensus-based pathway towards national presidential and parliamentary elections in 2023 and meet the aspirations of all Libyans to select their leaders through the ballot box.</p>
        </content>

          <p xml:space="preserve">		“The Security Council is encouraged by the SRSG’s initiative to launch a UN‑facilitated, Libyan High-Level Panel for Elections (HLPE), in particular, that it is intended to complement progress made by other processes and bring together stakeholders. The Security Council emphasises the importance of a participatory and representative process that includes representatives of political institutions and political figures, tribal leaders, civil society organisations, security actors, youth, and the full, equal and meaningful participation of women, and is therefore able to assist in reaching consensus on the necessary steps to conclude the electoral process, including finalising the constitutional basis and electoral laws, in an inclusive and transparent way, in order to ensure that any outcome of its actions and deliberations is acceptable and supported by all major Libyan stakeholders. The Security Council urges all stakeholders to engage fully, constructively, transparently, and in a spirit of compromise with the SRSG and to uphold guarantees concerning the independence and integrity of the inclusive electoral process, and election results. The Security Council underscores the importance of cooperation and constructive engagement between all relevant Libyan institutions in this regard. The Security Council further emphasises the importance of providing a safe environment for civil society organisations to work freely and to protect them from threats and reprisals.</p>
