Herard is the former head of the National Palace General Security Unit (USGPN) under President Jovenel Moïse. He has played a key role in enabling the activities of criminal networks and gangs in Haiti, including supporting the Ti Bwa gang in creating a special combat unit named “Back up 100 plak,” which has increased its fighting capacity. Herard has been implicated in facilitating the trafficking of arms and ammunition, which have fueled gang violence and destabilized the country. His actions have contributed to the expansion of gang control over key areas, further undermining Haiti’s security and governance.</p>

          <p xml:space="preserve">	Kempes Sanon has engaged in actions that threaten the peace, security, and stability of Haiti through his leadership of the Les Argentins gang, also known as the Bel Air gang, which operates from its stronghold in the Haut Bel-Air area of Port-au-Prince. With approximately 150 members, the gang has been involved in systematic human rights violations, including extortion, kidnappings, and illicit taxation. Sanon has played a significant role in consolidating gang power in Port-au-Prince, particularly through his involvement in the Viv Ansanm alliance, which has launched coordinated attacks to expand gang-controlled territories. Under his leadership, Les Argentins has conducted repeated assaults on neighborhoods like Solino, resulting in numerous casualties and the displacement of thousands of residents. Sanon also maintains a network of individuals within governmental institutions, including security agencies, which enables him to evade arrest and facilitate his criminal activities. He escaped from prison in 2021, where he was incarcerated for kidnapping, theft, and assassination, and has since continued to destabilize Haiti through his actions.</p>
